                <p>We here at <a href="https://rb.gy/wo6ha7">Fries.Pics</a> have spent long amounts of time putting work into delivering you the best one image channel we can.
                     Revising, procrastinating, suffering, losing our families in the process, we're proud to give you, Fries. </p>
                <p>Our one image channel is guaranteed to have 10x the ensured quality of other competitor one image channels.</p>

                <p>This all started oddly in the Biden server. Biden created a contest for whoever makes the best emotes keeps the event server (not main biden server).
                    Dr. Fries being the amazing awesome hot guy that he his made a bunch of good emotes for biden. He created a pact with another emote maker named Maya.
                    With the combined power of Dr. Fries and Maya they made the coolest, bestest emotes and won the contest.</p>
                <p>They debated for weeks figuring out what they wanted the server to become. They had one goal in common, make the best one image server. Maya suggested to make a competitor for the Burger server. Fries has been founded.</p>
                <p>Fries had a boost, starting with around 150 members. This made it possible to start partnerships immediately. We wanted to take over Burger in members. 
                    Mr. Burger joined fries, this was an intense moment. Dr. Fries and Mr. Burger started talking business, as you do.
                    They decided to not declare war, but declare peace. They created a partnership that still holds strong to this day. </p>
                <p>On August 8th 2021, Fries reached a milestone. Fries managed to reach 300 members, with the help of Binger's Burgers (formerly just Burger) advertising.
                    Apon reaching 300 members Dr. Fries decided to open a VC and try to make a thread. Even with the thread failing multiple times out of his sheer stupidity,
                    it managed to work. The VC was slight chaos but calmed down and Dr. Fries had a "civil" conversation with some members of Fries.

            <div class="content">
                <img class="soda-image" src="images/soda.png" alt="Sprite Soda">
                <p>This is a little story, all about our adopted child. It all started as a joke. "We need to have soda to complete the fast food trio" they said. 
                    They all decided to make a new server, but didn't know what it would be or who would run it.</p>
                <p>One hero rised from the ideas. It's name, was Soda. It was the perfect final piece that we've been looking for. One brave 5 year old rose up for the occasion and 
                    decided to take soda under their wing. Once the owner was picked there were deep conversations about what soda it should be. </p>
                <p>Ideas bounced from coke to fanta. Arguments got heated, opinions flew. But at the end, it was chosen. The final chosen brand was sprite, 
                    loved by all. And after all, the fabled McDonalds sprite was famous.</p>
                <p>The server started off well, but slowly degraded. It wasn't pure anymore. The server would host events often, and have messages daily in the sacred
                    soda channel. It was rarer to see the server with just the sprite image than it was to see it with a event or something going on. Fries tried to distance itself
                    from it's creation. Soda wasn't a real one image server anymore, and everyone knew it.</p>
                <p>To this day Soda has been inactive, no events or anything in a long time.</p>

                <span> Harris</span>
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="harris-image"></div>
                <p>There's this quite big server known as Harris. This server is one of the most annoying and putrid one image servers out there. There are many issues including
                    the owner doing shady partnerships, ownership being tossed around, bad moderation, and an overall lack of care.</p>
                <p>Starting off with shady partnerships. Fries did a couple of partners with Harris, 1 or 2. The partnership message got removed in Harris within 5 minutes, 
                    with no warning. The partnerships are one sided and complete scams, trying to make you not notice that they removed your ad. Even if your ad stays up
                    the server is inactive as hell even with 900+ members. You may able to get 3-15 people at most reacting within the hour. This is likely because of how many pings
                    there are.</p>
                <p>Pings happen constantly, getting upwards of 5 pings a day is really annoying and makes users less likely to actually look at them. You get pinged for the 
                    stupidest of reasons too. There's going to be an event happening that got thrown together in 5 minutes? You can bet you're getting pinged at least 3-5 times
                    for it. Each ping is like they're begging for people to look, and they are. Ever since the owner decided they didn't want the server anymore it's been downhill.</p>
                <p>Harris' ownership is in shambles. The owner has disowned the server and come back, switching who owns the server constantly. Even the moderators have issues,
                    one mod mass pinged and banned 20+ people, just to be unbanned and re-made a mod by the next day. Another mod is also considered an owner, they constantly send
                    useless pings and attempt to make bad events.</p>
                <p>The Harris server has been mishandled, abused, misused, and deserves to be treated better. If they can become more trustworthy, have less pings, and have a stable
                    team, then it could be a good server.
                </p> 
                <p> as of an unknown date I believe that the server has been either sold or deleted </p>
