# Notes
Yes, I know my code sucks.   
This is literally the first time ever that I truly learnt HTML and CSS, and it was for a joke.   
If it's truly awful, don't look at it that's your fault for criticising a complete and utter idiot.   

Ignore my stupid commit names I've changed how I do it like 5 times
